To start the project, I needed to get all of the files in one place for the project (there were a lot). I realized that I didn't really understand how to make a makefile with this many dependencies, so that was my next thing. I figured it out pretty quick, turned out to be a lot easier than I thought. Once I had the basics of the new makefile format down, I moved onto figuring out the data structure and how I would work between it and the virtual disk. This turned out to be a bit tricky. It didn't click very quickly. I went and studied zinspect to see how the given code was accomplishing this. It started to make more sense but I didn't understand how unions worked with structs. I emailed 3113 and ended up getting a pretty good explaination. From there, I quickly assembled zformat. This turned out to be quite easy. Write '\0' through the whole disk and selectivly configure very specific, staticly placed parts. So now I had a formatted disk and automated testing verified I did this right. From here, I tried to go to zfilez. I realized this was a dumb route as I didn't have any files to test with and I didn't want to manually create them like I did for zformat. So naturally I moved to zmkdir. This took the lions share of my time. It wasn't as hard as it was tedious, but once I had it working correctly it set me up to easily complete the rest of the project. By the time I finished zmkdir, I understood everything about the filesystem. I wanted to see the files I was making in a ls -1 format so I moved back to zfilez and created a very crude version that I was not very proud of. It worked (kind of) which was enough for me to move forward to zrmdir and see a bit of quick output. Zrmdir wasn't too bad. Probably was the second easiest part behind zformat. This was mostly because a lot of the required code was already made for zmkdir. Pretty much just rewrite and plug it in. At this point I was feeling good about it, but after running some of the student submitted tests on Canvas, I found out that zfilez was clearly getting buggy at the edge cases. I also realized that some of my initializations were using some macros that were incorect in zmkdir but this was only 2 lines of code. I went back to zfilez and rewrote it probably 3 times. Each time I got closer but it kept bugging out. I finally gave up on trying to write everything myself and read up on qsort(). I was avoiding using this on the directory entry struct becasue I kept getting lost in the pointers and couldn't wrap my head around it. Fourth try I got it working. Turns out I was overcomplicating it quite a bit. Ran my code on student tests and the provided tests and I was good to go. I also got the testing report this evening saying I'm passing everything (thank god). There is a lot going on at once in this project so it's stressfull not knowing if one or two things are a bit off. Luckily for me I'm sleeping tonight.
